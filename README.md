## 📖 Overview
**AirQualityAI** is a machine learning project designed to forecast the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for major Turkish cities (Malatya, Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa).

Unlike traditional weather apps that only show current conditions, this system analyzes **historical atmospheric data** (2 years) and **meteorological factors** (Wind, Temperature, Rain) to predict tomorrow's air quality risk using **Gradient Boosting** algorithms.

The project addresses real-world data challenges such as sensor failures (NaN values) by implementing robust data imputation techniques (Linear Interpolation & Backfill).

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Pollutant Analysis
The model integrates multiple pollutants to calculate a comprehensive risk score, complying with European Standards:
* **PM2.5 & PM10:** Particulate Matter (Dust)
* **NO2:** Nitrogen Dioxide (Traffic pollution)
* **O3:** Ozone
* **Meteorology:** Wind speed, direction, humidity, and precipitation

### 2. Robust Data Pipeline (Self-Healing)
Real-time API data often contains gaps. This system includes a self-healing pipeline:
* **Linear Interpolation:** Mathematically fills missing hourly data based on trends
* **Forward/Back Fill:** Ensures no zero-values break the model predictions
* **Real-time Calibration:** Uses the "Last Known Value" logic for live dashboarding, ensuring the user never sees "0.0" or "NaN"

### 3. Advanced AI Model
Built with `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` from Scikit-Learn, which is optimized for tabular time-series data. It learns:
* **Seasonality:** Winter pollution spikes vs. Summer trends
* **Lag Features:** How yesterday's pollution affects today
* **Weekend Effect:** Changes in industrial/traffic emissions on weekends

### 4. Professional Dashboard
A modern, dark-mode compatible web interface built with **Streamlit**. Features include color-coded risk cards, dynamic charts, and live data monitoring.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone or Download
Clone this repository or download the files to a folder.

### 2. Install Requirements
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Data Collection (ETL)
Fetch the historical data (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, Weather) from Open-Meteo:
```bash
python genis_veri_topla.py
```
Output: Creates `genis_hava_kalitesi.csv`

### 4. Model Training
Train the Gradient Boosting model and generate report graphs:
```bash
python genis_model_egit.py
```
Output: Saves the model to `models/` and plots to `grafikler/`

### 5. Launch the Dashboard
Start the web application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Methodology & Validation

### Satellite vs. Ground Stations
You might notice differences between this model (Satellite-based) and local ground stations (e.g., Municipal stations):

* **This Model (Background Level):** Uses Open-Meteo satellite/model data, representing the average air quality over a 10x10km grid. It reflects the general city atmosphere.
* **Ground Stations (Hotspots):** Often located near heavy traffic. They measure local "hotspots" (e.g., high NO2 from exhaust), leading to higher readings than regional averages.

**Conclusion:** Both are correct within their own spatial resolution. The model predicts the general atmospheric condition of the city.

### Performance Metrics
The model is evaluated using a 90/10 Train-Test split.

* **R² Score:** Indicates how well the model captures the variance in data.
* **Feature Importance:** Analysis shows that Previous Day's AQI (Lag) and PM2.5 levels are the strongest predictors for the next day's air quality.
